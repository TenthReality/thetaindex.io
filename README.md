## Inspiration
On February 4th, 2021 ThetaLabs released the ThetaSwap system which rapidly allowed many users and streamers of the Theta.TV platform to create Streamer-Based TNT-20 tokens and fund swap pairs.  However the ThetaSwap system makes pair discovery difficult, and offers little in the way of pair information for the community.  The enthusiastic response from the community, and desire to learn more about what pairs might exist, how popular the pairs were and what value they may have lead me to developing [thetaindex.io](https://thetaindex.io/).

## What it does
[thetaindex.io](https://thetaindex.io/) discovers TNT-20 token pairs on the ThetaSwap system and provides unprecedented near real-time information about pairs, swap pools and trades. Where possible, [thetaindex.io](https://thetaindex.io/) will attempt to determine a USD price value of a TNT-20 token based on available swap pairs and current TFUEL price, provide pool liquidity information and swap information about any pairs available!

## What's next for [thetaindex.io](https://thetaindex.io/)
Potential integration with the Chrome Wallet extension to allow for a "Portfolio" page and attempt to provide individual user asset tracking features.
